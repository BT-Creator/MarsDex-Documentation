# Non-login
This seems easy enough. The user was able to find all details
# Company
- The user had **major difficulties** with finding the logout button. I suggest adding a icon to the company name to indicate that it contains all I do surrounding account login & logout
- The user had **major difficulties** finding the notification. It seems like the bell icon doesn't convey that this is used as notification panel. I would suggest maybe placing a label under this.
## Marketplace
- The user didn't find **the button to make a outgoing request**. I'd suggest adding a plus marker or something similar as a button that will redirect to adding a new outgoing request.
- The user took a **long time** finding **a request that is finished**. I suggest making it so that finished orders are always on top.
# Goverment
- The user had difficulties finding the policies. Maybe change the "colonies" tab name to **"Colonies & Policies"**
