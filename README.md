# MarsDex
MarsDex is a web app that registers and trades resources on Mars. By resources we mean everything that grows on Mars or is in Mars. Our system can be perfectly used by any company to store, trade and purchase all their resources. The purpose of our platform is to map all sources on Mars. Our platform is made for Martians and for companies that produce, mine or need resources on Mars. Our platform does not only knows who has which goods, but also where they are.
