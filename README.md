## Introduction
MarsDex is a monitoring & index service to keep track of resources on Mars. 

Because of the harsh environmental factors on Mars, resource usage needs to be optimized, and the exchange of these needs to be easy.
MarsDex gives Mars Residents, company and government workers the tools to manage, exchange and keep track of resources on Mars.
With our extensive map of Mars & Transports routes, detailed lists of resources and easy-to-use marketplace, you can manage your resources with ease and enjoy the Martian view.
